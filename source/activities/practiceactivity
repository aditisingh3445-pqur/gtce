\subsection{Studio Organization}
    This worksheet is a bit shorter than most other worksheets to give time to discuss course and studio organization. We will discuss:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*)]
        \item What are studios? How are they different from lectures? \vfill
        \item How do TAs support your class? \vfill
        \item Studio recordings and worksheet solutions. \vfill
        \item How students can ask questions during studio. \vfill
        \item Office hours (please attend them!). \vfill
        \item General advice on how to succeed in linear algebra (and college!). \vfill
    \end{enumerate}
\newpage 
\subsection{Linear Systems}

A \Emph{linear system} is a set of linear equations. An example of a linear system with two equations is 
\begin{align*}
\begin{matrix}
 x +  3y &= \ 4
 \\[2pt]
 5 x  + 6y & = \ 5
\end{matrix}
\end{align*}

We might want to know:

\begin{itemize}
    \item what values of the unknowns satisfy all equations in the system, if any? 
    \item what procedure do we want to use to identify those values? 
\end{itemize}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \PromptDescribe \ It is best if we go through these questions one at a time. 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item What does it mean for a linear system to be consistent? 
            \vfill
            \item How can we determine whether a linear system is consistent?
            \vfill                  
            \item What are the three row operations that we can use to reduce a matrix?  
            \vfill                   
            \item What does it mean for a system to have a unique solution? 
            \vfill             
            \item What does it mean for two matrices to be row equivalent?       \vfill
        \end{enumerate}
        \newpage 
        % \item For what values of $h$ is the system consistent?
        %     \begin{align*}
        %     x_1 = 4, \qquad 2x_1 + h  x_2 + x_3= 8, \qquad h x_3 = 0
        %     \end{align*}
        \item \TorFshort
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If a linear system has more equations than unknowns, then the system cannot have a unique solution.
            \item If a linear system has more unknowns than equations, then the system could have an infinite number of solutions, or the system could have no solutions.
        \end{enumerate}
        Before moving on - what strategies does your TA(s) recommend that students can use to approach true/false questions? 
        \newpage 
        \item For what values of $A$ and $B$, if any, does the system have  (a) an infinite number of solutions?  (b) no solutions? (c) exactly one solution? 
        \begin{align*}
            x_1 + 2x_2 &= 1 \\
            Ax_1 + Bx_2 &= 2
        \end{align*}
        For the case where there are an infinite number of solutions, sketch the set of solutions. Note that sketches need to have labeled axes. The set of solutions should be a line that does not have arrows. 
        % \item Sketch the set of solutions to the linear system. 
        % \begin{align*}
        %     x - 4y &= 0 \\
        %     -2x +8y &= 0
        % \end{align*}    
        \newpage 

        \item Consider the line $x_2 = 2x_1$. 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Sketch any two points on the line. In this class we will always put $x_1$ on the horizontal axis. 
            \item Sketch the line. 
            \item Construct a linear system of equations so that the line is the solution set. Use at least two equations. How many equations could you have in your system?  
            \item If the point $(a,b)$ is any point in the solution set, is the point $(ka,kb)$ also in the solution set for any real number $k$? 
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
